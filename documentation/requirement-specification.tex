\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
Transport AS is a company that handles home delivery missions from a local storage. The purpose of this software is to help the logistics administrator to manage deliveries and for transport workers to get information about their missions.
\subsection{Limitations}
In this project functionality is prioritised over security.
User authentication is disregarded because of project timeconstraints.

\subsection{Users}
\begin{itemize}
     \item Logistics administrator
     \item Transport worker
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Overview}
An administrator would add a transportation worker, transportation vehicle. The administrator would then create a new mission with a transportation worker and a transportation vehicle. The transportation worker would then view the transportation missions to see his work for the coming time. A transportation worker would then mark the mission as completed when he completes the mission. Only the logistics administrator would be able to mark missions as canceled.
